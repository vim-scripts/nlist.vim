Description:
This provides a command and a function.  They both can be called with or
without a range.  In addition, they can be called with or without arguments.
Without a range they operate on the current line.  The arguments are described
below:

    arg1 -> the number to start at.  The default is one.  This will
            number your selected lines sequentially.  The start can be a
            number, ., $, or, 'x (like getline).
    arg2 -> Text to append after numbers.  The default is a space.
    arg3 -> Controls formatting.  Can be "left", "right", or "none".  The
            default is "right".

Examples:
    To make a list start at 1:
        :'<,'>Nlist
        :'<,'>call Nlist()
    To number the whole buffer (with it's actual line number):
        :%Nlist
        :%call Nlist()
    To number a subset of lines with their line number (and put a '] ' in
    front of every number):
        :'<,'>Nlist . ]\
        :'<,'>call Nlist(".", "] ")
    To number the whole buffer (with it's actual line number) without
    justification:
        :%Nlist 1 \ left
        :%call Nlist("1", " ", "none")

Example mappings that a user can define:
nnoremap <unique> <Leader>N :%Nlist<cr>
vnoremap <unique> <Leader>N :Nlist<cr>
